        <h2>2% milk over whole milk.</h2>
        <h4>By: <em>Lukas Curtil</em></h4>
        <h5>Published: <em>Wednesday, September 24th</em></h5>
        <p>I have never been a fan of whole milk but I moved in with some roomates this year who prefer whole milk so I thought i'd give it a try. It's really not that great and I don't think i'll ever prefer it over 2% milk, which is what i've drank my whole life and what I think is significantly better than whole milk. Maybe whole milk has better nutritional value, but that's not a big deal to me so I don't really mind. I do know that there are way more milk types out there and honestly I might like some of them you never know. I do know for a fact that I will never like lactose free milk or almond milk though, those are a definite no.</p>
        <p>The idea of milking cows has always seemed interesting to me since my grandparents live in a very farm based village in France so I saw lots of cows all the time and my grandpa even brought me to a milking complex when I was younger. I remember thinking that it was honestly kind of gross at the time. Overall i'm a big fan of milk and a big fan of cows for being able to produce that milk and at the end of the day, milk is just milk.</p>
        <p>Here's a table of different milks and how they rank against each other.</p>
        <div>
          <table>
              <thead>
                  <tr>
                      <th>Milk Type</th>
                      <th>Satisfaction Rate</th>
                      <th>Milk Index Score</th>
                      <th>Would Buy?</th>
                  </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                  <tr>
                      <td>Whole Milk</td>
                      <td>5/10</td>
                      <td>56</td>
                      <td>No</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                      <td>2% Milk</td>
                      <td>9/10</td>
                      <td>92</td>
                      <td>Yes</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                      <td>Almond Milk</td>
                      <td>1/10</td>
                      <td>11</td>
                      <td>No</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                      <td>Lactose Free Milk</td>
                      <td>2/10</td>
                      <td>28</td>
                      <td>No</td>
                  </tr>

        <h2>My favorite activity at the moment.</h2>

        <p>My roomates and I have recently bought a football and have been tossing it around a lot . We usually head out back to the parking lot behind our apartment which is not big at all, but still is a decent place to toss the pigskin around. We also have an open grass lot that's across the street from our apartment that we go to sometimes, just depends on what the mood is. I've been dialing in my football throwing abilities and have been trying to dial in my spiral which has been going pretty well. I still lack that pure arm strength but I can get by. </p>
        <p>I am as much of a fan of throwing the football around as I am of watching it. I got into football once I got into high school because honestly, I never really watched it before then. But I remember enjoying watching the games there and that led me to watching NFL and the Lions obviously. Recently, I have been really excited to watch and I am just glad the season is back and i'm glad the Lions are doing well even though they completley choked to the Packers in week one but its alright.</p>
